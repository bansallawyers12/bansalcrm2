# Git from Chat

When the user asks to **commit**, **push**, **pull**, or run **git** from this chat:

1. **Do not run git in the agent terminal** (it will fail with Permission denied / no credentials).
2. **Tell the user to run the matching task** so the command runs in their integrated terminal (full access):

   - **Commit and push:** Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** → type **Tasks: Run Task** → choose **Git: Commit and Push** → enter commit message when prompted.
   - **Pull:** **Ctrl+Shift+P** → **Tasks: Run Task** → **Git: Pull**.
   - **Push only:** **Ctrl+Shift+P** → **Tasks: Run Task** → **Git: Push**.

3. Optionally show the shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+P** then "Run Task" then pick the Git task.
4. Tasks are defined in `.vscode/tasks.json` and run in the user's terminal (same window as chat).

This way the user "executes from chat" by following the instruction; the actual git runs in their terminal with .git and credentials access.
